            <p class="w-8/12 pt-16">I am Francesca Orrù, I am 22 years old and I am a Frontend developer. I graduated from the G. Marconi
                 Technical Technological Institute in Rovereto (Italy) in 2020. I have worked in Padua as a Frontend Developer
                 for almost 2 years using mostly Angular and I'm currently starting a Frontend Developer’s bachelor at Harbour.Space
                 university in Barcelona. Developing for me is not just a job but a part of who I am, the development of websites and apps is
                 the branch where I can fully 
                express myself and where my creativity and attention to detail can be exploited to the fullest.</p>

            <p class="w-8/12 pt-16">I am an expansive person and this leads me to have a strong predisposition to communication, 
                working in teams and being a sunny and comforting presence in many situations; I also have a
                strong character that gives me security in proposing alternative solutions.
                I am also a person who loves to learn and face new challenges while working, so I like to work on new things
                that give me the chance to learn as much as possible.</p>
